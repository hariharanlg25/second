PDCA :
	PDCA, or Plan-Do-Check-Act, is a four-step method for continuous improvement in processes and systems. Also known as the Deming Cycle, named after Dr. W. Edwards Deming, each step plays a role in driving improvement:

Plan: Establish objectives, identify improvement opportunities, and develop plans.

Do: Implement the plan, execute processes, and collect data.

Check: Monitor and evaluate results against objectives, identify variances, and analyze root causes.

Act: Take corrective actions, adjust plans, modify processes, and enhance performance.
